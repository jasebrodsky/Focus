                    and private, [and we do not share individualized personal information with

                    information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of

                    information to us. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has
                    registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will
                    terminate that person's registration and delete their Registration
                    Information from Focus. If we do delete a profile because you violated our
                    minimum age requirement, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure
                    that you do not try to create a new profile.

                    about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information

                    In addition, under California law, operators of online services are

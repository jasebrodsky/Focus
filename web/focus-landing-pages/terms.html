                    “Website”) (collectively the App and Website will be referred to as the
                    “Service”). The Terms are a binding contractual commitment between you and

                    Creating an Account

                <p dir="ltr">
                    Before you can use our App, you will need to register for an account
                    ("Account"). You can create an Account by using your Facebook login
                    details. When you create an Account using your Facebook login details, you
                    authorize Focus to access, display and use certain information from your
                    Facebook account (e.g., profile pictures, relationship status, location and
                    information about Facebook friends). You represent that you are entitled to
                    disclose your Facebook account login information to Focus and/or grant Focus
                    access to your Facebook Account (including, but not limited to, for the
                    purposes described here) without breach by you of any of the terms and
                    conditions that govern your use of Facebook and without obligating Focus to
                    pay any fees or making Focus subject to any usage limitations imposed by
                    such third-party service providers.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Please note that your relationship with Facebook is governed solely by your
                    agreement(s) with Facebook, and Focus disclaims any liability for personally
                    identifiable information that may be provided to it by Facebook in
                    violation of the privacy settings that you have set in such account.

                    Registration Data
                </h3>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    In registering for the Service, you agree to (1) provide true, accurate,
                    current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
                    Services’ registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (2) maintain and
                    promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current,
                    and complete. You are responsible for all activity on your Account. You may
                    not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to notify
                    Focus immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other
                    breach of security. If you provide any information that is untrue,
                    inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Focus has reasonable grounds to
                    suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
                    incomplete, Focus has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and
                    refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion
                    thereof).

                    Right to Terminate Accounts
                </h3>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    For your safety, Focus reserves the right to terminate or suspend any
                    Account for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, claims by a
                    third party that a username violates the third party’s rights, and most
                    importantly, if we believe the Account demonstrates inappropriate behavior.
                    Focus also reserves the right to make use of any operational, technological,
                    legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without
                    limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability
                    and without the need to give you prior notice.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    You agree not to create an Account or use the Service if your Account has
                    been previously terminated by Focus for any reason.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    While we do our best to monitor the Focus community, remember to always use
                    your best judgment when interacting with people on or off the App. If
                    someone has made you uncomfortable for any reason, please report them,
                    either via the App or by emailing [help@focusdating.co]. In addition, we
                    have provided tips to ensure that you enjoy the service and stay safe at
                    [link to list of tips for a safe and fun first offline meeting].

                    Leaving the App
                </h3>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    We hate to see you go, but the purpose of the Service is for you to find a
                    genuine connection. So, if that happens or you have any other reason to
                    leave the Service, you can either pause your Account by going to the
                    'Settings' page when you are logged in and clicking on the 'Pause account'
                    link; or you can delete your Account at any time, by going to the
                    'Settings' page when you are logged in and clicking on the 'Delete account'
                    link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little
                    while for Your Content to be completely removed from the App. We will save
                    your profile information in case you decide to restore your Account (which
                    you can do within 30 days of de-activating your Account).

                    If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you will be prompted to enter
                    details for your account with the Third Party Store you are using (e.g.,
                    Android, Apple, etc.) (your “Mobile Platform Account”), and your Mobile
                    Platform Account will be charged for the Premium Service and/or In-App
                    Product in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of
                    purchase, as well as the general terms applicable to all other in-app
                    purchases made through your Mobile Platform Account (e.g., Android, Apple,
                    etc.). Premium Services and In-App Products may include one-time purchases
                    as well as monthly subscriptions (e.g., a one-month subscription,
                    three-month subscription, six-month subscription, etc.) to additional
                    account features. At the end of the free trial period (if any), you will be
                    charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until
                    you cancel your subscription, except in the case of Focus AppCoins where
                    there shall be no automatic renewal. Please note that for Premium Services
                    and In-App Products made on a subscription basis, your subscription will
                    automatically renew for the same subscription period as you initially
                    purchased (e.g., if you made an In-App Product for a six-month
                    subscription, your subscription will be automatically renewed for an
                    additional six-months). To avoid any charges for additional periods, you
                    must cancel before the end of the free trial period, subscription period or
                    renewal, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of your
                    Mobile Platform Account and the terms and conditions of any applicable
                    Third Party Store. The pricing may vary due to a number of factors, such as
                    (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses and other
                    discounts.

                    Please note that for Premium Services and In-App Products you will be

                    service-related issues, including those issues that may arise from
                    inaccurate account information, or products or goods you obtain through
                    your Mobile Platform Account or Third Party Stores. Further, Focus does not

                    descriptions, images, and references; to limit the available quantity of

                    to the App because you have breached these Terms, you shall not be entitled
                    to a refund of any unused portion of any fees, payments or other
